			<h3>Work experience</h3>
			<p>
				2016-2017: 6 months, Villefranche-sur-Saône (Rhône-Alpes, France). I helped teachers in the social reinsertion of incarcerated people. I taught science in small groups. This leadership experience allowed me to have a more global comprehension of society with its different social groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				2018: 3 months, Fidesio SAS Paris. I developed a machine learning tool to help following the progress of teams on their projects. This internship allowed me to discover the environment of start-ups, and to learn web development skills (activity of Fidesio).

					Sailing!! I spent 7 years sailing every week, and I'd love to do a round-the-world sailing trip, going by all the remotest and coldest places in the world... Among others: Tristan da Cunha, Bouvet Island, Pitcairn Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Jan Mayen Island
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3" style="width: 225px">
					<img data-src="holder.js/200x200" class="img-thumbnail" alt="200x200" src="casseTete" style="width: 200px; height: 200px"><br>
					Maths: you may have understood that, I love maths. But big incomprehensible theorems are not my thing. I like finding an original approach to a problem that suddenly makes it easy. It is the use of imagination that I enjoy more precisely.
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3" style="width: 225px">
					<img data-src="holder.js/200x200" class="img-thumbnail" alt="200x200" src="voyage" style="width: 200px; height: 200px"><br>
					I am quite fond of stories of voyages. I am often reading the book of an explorer, travelling with him in unknown territories. Lasts in date: Bougainville, François Paron, Darwin, ...
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3" style="width: 225px">
					<img data-src="holder.js/200x200" class="img-thumbnail" alt="200x200" src="carteElectronique" style="width: 200px; height: 200px"><br>
					Here's the origin of my choice of studies: I can't stand the fact that I don't understand anything about computers. So here I am trying to comprehend the mechanisms between hardware and software. It seems to me taht this is the key in creating various connected terminals. Wish me luck: this is huge!

					Cooking is one of my hobbies. I'd like to grow my own food, this gives the meals such a new taste!! Even if it is time consuming, cooking is incredibly satisfying. We can see our success by following recipes, and then innovating on those. Eating's good, cooking's better!
